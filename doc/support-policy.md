# Container Support Policy

As of Friday October 28th, 2022 we, the Kitmaker Team at Nvidia, responsible for the Nvidia CUDA Repositories and CUDA container images, are formally announcing a new support policy for CUDA Container Images.

Going forward, *Cuda Toolkit images will End-of-Life (EOL) when the driver it shipped with goes EOL. * In addition, we will only support the latest point release for each of these toolkit versions.

For example, CUDA 11.7.1 shipped with R515. R515 goes EOL May 2023, so CUDA 11.7.1 images will no longer be updated starting May 2023.

Once a CUDA container image set has gone EOL, we will update the Message of the Day for the image to indicate it has reached EOL. We will also provide notification via a gitlab issue our customers can subscribe to.

After a period of Six Months time, the EOL tags **WILL BE DELETED from Docker Hub and Nvidia GPU Cloud (NGC)**. This deletion ensures unsupported tags (and image layers) are not left lying around for customers to continue using after they have long been abandoned.


## Why

Earlier this year, we had to change the CUDA repo signing key. This had a reverberating impact across many parts of the software we support, but the worst and most surprising were the CUDA Container Images. We found many of our customers were still using no longer supported image tags that we had no way to easily update. Since there has never been a formal support policy in place, we had to update all currently supported image sets and revive legacy code to rebuild old unsupported image sets, and in some cases even this was not feasible.

Due to the nature of shipping practically an entire OS distribution in a container image, these old image sets also include critical CVE vulnerabilities and anyone using any container images should perform regular updates as a best practice.

## Disruption potential

Deleting tags is not ideal. Each tag contains unique "image layers" that when removed can break any image that uses that layer. "Break" in this context means standard container pull commands will fail due to missing image layers leaving users with a not-so-nice error message from the client. Holding onto these image layers is also not sustainable. CUDA is an extremely large software project, and we have not been great at cleaning house which has resulted in our systems having to build and push multiple terabytes of container images every month for tags that barely get any downloads from the public repositories we push to.

We feel once our customers get used to this new support policy, disruptions will reduce to minimum and we can focus our efforts on image sets and tags that actually get used.

## When

We are announcing the policy change today, but it will not get activated until the next CUDA toolkit major version is released. Then six months after that we will start removing tags.

Also, expect a formal blog post announcing the changes soon.
